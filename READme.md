# stash command
This command is used to store out incomplete data temporarily to our branches, so that it will not interfere while pushing the data on github.

git stash        (It is used to temporarily store or hide the data  on current branch)
git stash pop    (it will show the data on current branch)
git stash apply  (it will show the temporariy stored data on another branches)
